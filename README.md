# Tleng.py 1

> ## ⚠️ ABONDED PROJECT

This is the first version of the engine that I was working on until I scraped it, and started from scratch for the second version of tleng.

I don't have any documantation for this engine, whatever you see it is on the comments.

Major differences are the structure of classes and more.

The code is outdated.

main1.py is the testing ground before updating main.py 

If you want to use it, copy the tleng1.py.
